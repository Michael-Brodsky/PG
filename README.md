# Pg (Pretty Good)

Pg is a development library for the Arduino (avr) platform that includes a C++ Standard Library which uses only static memory, interfaces for implementing common C++ design patterns, components for common system tasks such as scanning a keypad or writing formatted output to an lcd, and a set of utilities including timers, schedulers, eeprom streaming support, fast math algorithms and engineering functions.

This is a work in progress with almost daily updates. Check back often for more stuff!
