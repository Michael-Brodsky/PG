 *	Description:
 *
 *		This file defines objects in the <bit> header of the C++ Standard
 *		Library - to the extent they are supported by the Arduino
 *		implementation. The objects behave according to the C++ ISO/IEC 14882
 *		Standards, except as noted. 
 * 
 *  Notes:
 * 
 *      The <bit> header is part of the C++20 Standard Library and this file 
 *      contains only a minimal implementation. The <lib/imath.h> header has 
 *      equivalent versions of the functions defined in <bit>.
