# Pg Interface Library

The Interfaces library defines several abstract interface classes for implementing common C++ design patterns.

### iclockable.h 
Defines an interface for creating asynchronous, event-driven objects and applications.

### icloneable.h 
Defines an interface for instantiating objects using the C++ "Virtual Constructor Idiom".

### icommand.h 
Defines an interface and several concrete types for implementing the C++ "Command" design pattern.

### icomponent.h 
Defines an interface for implementing the C++ "Mediator" design for component types.

### imediator.h 
Defines an interface for implementing the C++ "Mediator" design for mediator types.

### iserializable.h 
Defines an interface for creating objects that can be serialized into a data stream for transmission and storage.
