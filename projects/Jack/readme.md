Jack is open source software that emulates the commercial LabJack(tm) devices on Arduino boards. It turns an Arduino into a data acquisition (DAQ) device that can be controlled by a remote host, over a network, using a simple query language. Hosts can set the board's pin modes, read and write values to and from the pins, count and time events and control other board features. Jack supports network connections over USB (serial), WiFi and Ethernet. Updates uploaded regularly, check back often.
