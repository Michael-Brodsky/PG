# Pg Projects Library
A collection of projects built with the Pg Libraries demonstrating modern, object-oriented design methodologies. 

### PIDThermostatEZ 
A super simple example of a thermostat that uses the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm to generate a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) output to control machinery, such as a heater. 

### Stopwatch
A simple stopwatch program that uses Pg components to provide a fully functioning user interface.

### Thermometer
A programmable digital thermometer with a fully functioning user interface, alarm, editable settings and EEPROM storage/recall.
