*          Jack Commands          *
***********************************

Jack executes "commands" sent as "messages" over a network connection. Commands and messages are 
synonymous, with the latter simply refering to a command transmitted over the network. Commands are 
text strings having the general form:

	key[=arg0,arg1,...,argN]

where "key" is a unique character string identifying the command, optionally followed by a comma-
separated list of arguments separated by an equal '=' character. Jack has a list of built-in commands 
for executing most common microcontroller tasks, such as setting GPIO pin modes and states. This 
list can be expanded with custom commands and functions.


/////////////////////////////////
//      Built-In Commands      // 
/////////////////////////////////

Command arguments are sent as text strings. Arguments are typed, where:

	s - string (any valid alphanumeric character except special characters: ',' '=' ':', 
	b - byte (8-bit unsigned integer in [0-255]), 
	i - int (16-bit unsigned integer in [0-65535]), 
	l - long (32-bit unsigned integer in [0-4294967295])
	f - float (signed floating point decimal).

Programs must first be downloaded to the device before they can be operated. This is initiated by 
sending the "program begin load" command, pgm=1. Once received, all subsequent messages are considered 
as program text and stored until receipt of the "program end load" command, pgm=0. Once loaded, the 
program can be operated as described above. New programs are downloaded by sending the program begin 
load command again. The current program, if any, is erased and any new program text is stored on the 
device. Programs can only be loaded while the current program is inactive (halted). Program operation 
commands (2-8) are executed only if a new program is not currently loading. Device programming is 
described in document <Programming.txt>
