Jack is part of a software library and application suite that allows inexpensive microcontroller-based
devices to function as remote control, data acquisition (DAQ) and IoT platforms. Along with its 
desktop counterpart View, Jack forms the basis of a general purpose HMI/SCADA system.

Remote hosts communicate with Jack devices over a network connection, and can configure and control 
them using simple commands. Hosts can also download programs to Jack devices that execute remotely on 
the device. This can increase device functionality while significantly reducing host workload and 
network traffic.

Jack supports all typical microcontroller functions, including configuring general purpose 
input/output (GPIO) pins, reading and setting pin states, counting and timing pin events, network and 
device configuration and more. Jack also supports EEPROM storage and recall of device settings, 
allowing devices to be placed into a known state after power-cycling or reset.

Jack is compatible with a wide range of hardware devices that use the AVR, MEGAAVR, SAM and SAMD 
architectures. This includes Arduino, ST Micro, Teensy, Microchip and other boards.

Jack supports connectivity over USB (Serial), Ethernet and WiFi networks and communicates using  
simple commands. Messages are sent and received as text strings having the general form: 

	key=value1,value2,...,valueN

This allows any host capable of sending and receiving text messages to interact with Jack devices 
and makes development of host applications simple. Messages have a human-readable syntax. For 
example:

	rdp=p		; reads the input state of pin p,
	wrp=p,v		; writes value v to output pin p, 
	inf		; reads the device hardware information.

Replies are sent in similar fashion. For instance, Jack will reply to the rdp=p message with:

	p=v

where p is the pin number and v the current input state. Hosts can parse replies and take appropriate 
action. Jack can also acknowledge receipt of messages and validate messages using checksums. 

Developers can add custom device functionality by expanding Jack's built-in command set with client-
defined commands. These operate similarly to remote procedure calls (RPC), where a message triggers 
a client-defined function on the device and optionally returns a reply.

Jack provides a programming language for devices that support remote programming. The language 
syntax is very similar to assembly language and includes instructions for saving and moving data, 
logical and arithmetic operations, branching, looping, stack operations and subroutine calls.

Jack devices can fulfill nearly any HMI, SCADA, DAQ or IoT role. Jack can remotely operate other 
devices, read sensors and control machinery, apparatus and plant processes. Home automation systems, 
a growing market, are easily implemented using Jack. Custom, intelligent application development is  
simple with Jack's expandability and remote programming features.
